"""DES, only because VNC's original security type is built on it.

This lives in its own module so ``rfb.py`` can stay readable: it is a hundred
lines of standard tables that nobody should have to scroll past to follow a
protocol conversation.  Nothing else in yRDP may import it — if a second caller
ever appears, that is the moment to ask why the tool is doing cryptography by
hand instead of calling a library.

Two things about VNC's use of DES are famously wrong-looking and are both
correct:

* the password is used as the KEY, not the plaintext — the server sends a
  16-byte challenge and the client returns it encrypted;
* every key byte is **bit-reversed** first.  That is not obfuscation and not a
  mistake in this file: the original implementation fed bits to the DES engine
  in the opposite order, every VNC server since has copied it, and a "corrected"
  version simply fails to authenticate anywhere.

The password is truncated to 8 bytes and zero-padded, which is the protocol's
own limit rather than ours.  A caller that wants a stronger secret wants a
different security type, not a longer string here.
